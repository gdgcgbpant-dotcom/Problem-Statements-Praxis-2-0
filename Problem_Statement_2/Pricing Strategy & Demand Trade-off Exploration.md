## 🛒 Pricing Strategy & Demand Trade-off Exploration

### Theme
Retail Analytics | Revenue Strategy | Decision Science

### Context
Retail pricing decisions influence demand, brand perception, inventory flow, and profitability. Managers often rely on static rules or intuition, lacking tools to explore trade-offs between price, visibility, and sales performance.

### Problem
Create a pricing and demand exploration framework that allows decision-makers to understand how different pricing and merchandising choices influence outcomes across product categories and outlet types.

### What the Solution Should Enable
- Predict or estimate demand under varying conditions  
- Analyze sensitivity to price, visibility, and context  
- Compare short-term gains vs long-term impact  
- Translate data into business-ready narratives  

### Open Design Space
Teams may include:
- Scenario simulation (“what if price ↑ but visibility ↓?”)  
- Category-level and outlet-level comparisons  
- Elasticity or trend discovery  
- Strategic summaries for non-technical users  

### Evaluation Focus
- Actionability of recommendations  
- Interpretability of trade-offs  
- Business realism and clarity
