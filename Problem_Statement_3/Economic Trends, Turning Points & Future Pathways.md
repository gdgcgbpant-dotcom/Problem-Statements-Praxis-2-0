## 🌍 Economic Trends, Turning Points & Future Pathways

### Theme
Macroeconomics | Forecasting | Policy Insight

### Context
Economic indicators like GDP are widely tracked but poorly interpreted. Policymakers and analysts need tools that reveal patterns, shifts, and long-term trajectories—not just numbers.

### Problem
Develop a macroeconomic exploration and forecasting workflow that helps users understand how economies evolve over time, detect turning points, and reason about future paths under uncertainty.

### What the Solution Should Enable
- Multi-year forecasts with error awareness  
- Identification of growth, stagnation, or recovery phases  
- Cross-country and regional comparisons  
- Clear narratives explaining why trends occur  

### Open Design Space
Teams may focus on:
- Trend segmentation and regime shifts  
- Continent-level vs country-level analysis  
- Shock detection (pandemics, crises, rebounds)  
- Automatically generated economic briefs  

### Evaluation Focus
- Soundness of reasoning  
- Depth of temporal analysis  
- Communication of uncertainty and assumptions
