# Praxis 2.0 — GenAI + Machine Learning Innovation Showcase

Welcome to the official problem statement repository for **Praxis 2.0**, organized by **GDG on Campus – GB Pant**.

This repository contains the problem statements, rules, timelines, and submission expectations for the event.

---

## Quick Overview

**Praxis 2.0** is a **GenAI + Machine Learning innovation showcase** where student teams design and build functional prototypes that address real-world challenges.

Unlike traditional hackathons, Praxis 2.0 runs through **guided phases**, allowing teams to move from ideation to execution to a final **offline prototype showcase**. The focus is on thoughtful problem-solving, technical depth, and real-world relevance rather than speed alone.

---

## What Participants Are Expected to Build

Teams are expected to deliver a **working prototype**, not just a concept.

A complete submission should demonstrate:
- A clear understanding of the problem
- Effective use of **Machine Learning** for analysis or prediction
- Meaningful use of **Generative AI** for reasoning, explanation, or insight generation
- Practical relevance and usability

---

## Expected Deliverables

Each team must submit the following:

- **Public GitHub Repository**  
  - Complete source code  
  - Clear README explaining the approach, architecture, and assumptions  

- **Demo Video**  
  - Short walkthrough of the working prototype  
  - Explanation of the problem, solution, and key insights  

- **Live Link (if hosted)**  
  - Web app, dashboard, or deployed service (optional but encouraged)  

- **Documentation**  
  - Model details and evaluation metrics  
  - Explanation of how ML + GenAI are integrated  
  - Any ethical, bias, or limitation considerations
