## Who We Are

**Google Developer Groups on Campus (GDG) GB Pant** is a student-led community focused on building technical excellence, fostering innovation, and creating real-world impact through hands-on learning experiences.

**Praxis** is our flagship innovation showcase—designed to go beyond conventional hackathons.

---

## What is Praxis 2.0?

**Praxis 2.0** is a **GenAI + Machine Learning–focused innovation showcase** where student teams design and build functional prototypes that address real-world challenges.

Unlike traditional 24–48 hour hackathons, Praxis 2.0 unfolds through **guided, structured phases** that take teams from:
- Idea formulation  
- To thoughtful execution  
- To a final offline prototype showcase  

The emphasis is on:
- Depth over speed  
- Reasoning over demos  
- Impact over gimmicks  

Participants are encouraged to explore how **Machine Learning and Generative AI** can work together to support decision-making, insight generation, and responsible problem-solving.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:
- 📌 Detailed problem statements across multiple domains  
- 📊 Dataset and modeling expectations  
- 🧠 Guidelines for integrating ML + GenAI  
- 🏁 Event rules, timelines, and evaluation focus  

Each problem statement is intentionally open-ended to allow creativity in architecture, modeling choices, and presentation.

## 📊 Data, Modeling & Reasoning Note

For each problem statement, a **curated dataset will be provided** to participants as a baseline.

Teams are expected to apply **Machine Learning techniques** for tasks such as prediction, forecasting, segmentation, classification, or pattern discovery, using appropriate evaluation metrics.

To support explanation, reasoning, summarization, and insight generation, teams may use **Generative AI**, including:
- Open-source large language models  
- Free-tier APIs such as **Gemini**

The choice of tools, frameworks, or architectures is left open.

Submissions should demonstrate **meaningful integration of ML + GenAI**, where analytical outputs are translated into **clear, human-understandable insights**.

> There is **no requirement** to build a chatbot or conversational interface.  
> GenAI may be used in any form that improves reasoning, clarity, or decision support.
