## 🏥 Preventive Risk & Clinical Decision Support

### Theme
Healthcare | Preventive Medicine | Human-AI Collaboration

### Context
Chronic diseases such as diabetes often develop silently. By the time symptoms appear, interventions become costly and outcomes worsen. Clinicians operate under time pressure, limited historical data, and uncertainty—while patients struggle to understand probabilistic health risks.

### Problem
Design a clinical decision support workflow that helps surface early risk signals from routine patient data and supports informed, timely interventions—without overwhelming doctors or misleading patients.

### What the Solution Should Enable
- Transform structured patient data into risk estimates with uncertainty  
- Identify key contributing factors and modifiable drivers  
- Communicate findings differently for clinicians and patients  
- Suggest next-step actions (tests, lifestyle changes, follow-ups)

### Open Design Space
Teams may explore:
- Risk scoring, stratification, or cohort discovery  
- Counterfactual reasoning (“what would reduce risk most?”)  
- Longitudinal patient tracking  
- Bias detection and safety considerations

### Evaluation Focus
- Clinical relevance of insights  
- Clarity and trustworthiness of explanations  
- Usability in real OPD / clinic workflows
