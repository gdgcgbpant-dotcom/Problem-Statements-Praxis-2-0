## 🌡 Climate Trends, Risk Signals & Local Implications

### Theme
Climate Analytics | Sustainability | Public Policy

### Context
Climate datasets are vast, but communities and governments struggle to convert them into localized, actionable understanding of risk and long-term change.

### Problem
Create a climate trend and risk interpretation workflow that helps users understand how environmental patterns are changing and what those changes imply for regions and populations.

### What the Solution Should Enable
- Detection of long-term warming or variability trends  
- Regional comparison of climate shifts  
- Forward-looking projections with uncertainty  
- Clear, responsible communication of risks  

### Open Design Space
Teams may explore:
- Risk indices or composite indicators  
- Regional or population exposure analysis  
- Policy-oriented summaries  
- Visual storytelling and reports  

### Evaluation Focus
- Real-world relevance and responsibility  
- Analytical depth  
- Clarity for non-technical stakeholders
